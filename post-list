        <h2>The Digital Detective: How AI is Revolutionizing Murder Investigations</h2>
        <p><em>Published: January 21, 2026</em></p>

        <p>The classic image of a homicide investigation often involves a weary detective hunched over a desk scattered with grainy polaroids. Today, Artificial Intelligence has become a silent partner in solving these crimes.</p>

        <h3>Real-Time Detection</h3>
        <p>In many modern "smart cities," AI is the first to know a crime has occurred. Systems like ShotSpotter use microphones to triangulate gunshots within seconds, often alerting police before a 911 call is even placed.</p>

        <h3>Digital Forensics</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant way AI finds out about murders is by "interrogating" digital ghosts. AI tools scan terabytes of text messages, GPS coordinates, and search histories to find patterns—like a suspect searching for cleaning supplies shortly after a crime.</p>

        <h3>Biological Analysis</h3>
        <p>AI has moved the "CSI lab" into the future. DNA Phenotyping uses machine learning to predict a suspect's physical appearance—eye color, hair color, and facial structure—from just a drop of blood.</p>
